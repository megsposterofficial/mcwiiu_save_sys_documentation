# Minecraft WiiU Save Documentation
This repo shows the FULL Documentation of both Minecraft Wii U save files, .ext and the actual world data. Finally, UMT, MCCToolChest don't have any more secrets anymore.
I recommend downloading the .txt files of the documents, since github makes it harder to read.
Inside of the Scripts folder is a markdown file on how to use the script.
