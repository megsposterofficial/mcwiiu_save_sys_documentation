## How to use my tag extractor python tool for dissecting MC Wii U world saves.

### Have your world file named `savegame.wii`, and put it in the same directory as `tag_extractor.py`.

### If you have python installed, double click the script to run it, it will create a new folder with the extracted tags.

### Install python if you do not have it installed, https://www.python.org/downloads/.

### If you really needed this read the document for world data and the source code for this script.
